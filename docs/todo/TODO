## Current List
- Correct array GetElement accesses - allow for value types (agg literals)
- Create reference vs value types (potentially <2 words is a value type, anything mutable is ref)
- Implement signed and unsigned integers
- Guarantee 16-byte stack alignment for x64 at calls
- Optimize `!=` in MIR/assembly to consolidate `LogNot` after call `Eq` instruction or call to `equals` method
- Better errors for variables with mismatched types in or pattern branches

## Old List

# Errors
- Add non-fatal parse errors with recovery
- Parse recovery at statement bounds?
- Make missing parens around if test have unique error message, and support recovery
- Extra locs and help shown in errors
  - For inexhaustive return, show func decl as well with label, or point to if statement/branch that is inexhaustive
  - For unreachable statement after return, show loc of return as well?
  - For multiple main functions, show both
- Enforce initialization order for globals
- Enforce what expressions can appear in global initializers

# Features
- Do while loops
- Labels for break and continue
- Floating point numbers
- unicode encodings
- Pattern matching (syntax with optional: "| ?a -> 1" or "| ?(a, b) -> 1")
- Unused variable errors/warnings
- Errors vs warnings
- Allow mutually recursive adjacent functions in a block

# FUN IDEAS
- MACROS (e.g. defined as functions that operate on the source ast and output another ast)

# Full Pipeline
- IR Generation (In Progress)
- Compile IR (TODO)
  - LLVM IR backend
  - custom x86-64 backend
  - custom arm64 backend
  - custom wasm backend
  - Convert to bytecode and write VM
