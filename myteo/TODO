# Errors
- Add non-fatal parse errors with recovery
- Parse recovery at statement bounds?
- Make missing parens around if test have unique error message, and support recovery

# Features
- Assignment
- Ternary Operator
- For loops (traditional, for-each)
- While loops
- Do while loops
- Break, continue and labels
- Vecs, maps, and sets
- Arrays and bitwise ops?
- Anonymous Functions (fn x -> x)
- Lex negative numbers
- Floating point numbers
- Hex/octal/binary representations, unicode encodings
- Tuples
- Algebraic data types
- Destructuring
- Optional/None type
- Indexing into collections
- Pattern matching (syntax with optional: "| ?a -> 1" or "| ?(a, b) -> 1")
- Pattern matching exhaustiveness checking
